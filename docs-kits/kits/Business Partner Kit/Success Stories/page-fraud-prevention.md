How is the service related to BPDM?
The fraud prevention service provides information on most recent fraud cases which have been shared within the Catena-X (CX) network by contributing companies. The service comprises reporting capability for creating and sharing a fraud case as well as  a dashboard with graphical standard reports and filter / export functions.
The Fraud prevention service addresses the lack of a trusted data source for reported fraud cases. Currently, there is no solution in the automotive sector
With the fraud prevention service such a data source is created while CX members share individually and anonymously such data about fraudulent Business Partner data like compromised bank data of a supplier.
Based on this information the CX members are able to screen internally their own business partner and can identify problematic data. Then counter measures can taken like blocking payments and contacting the affected business partner.
So the Fraud Prevention Service – like other VAS services – provides a further building block for obtaining a 360-degree view of Business Partners in the sense of Know Your Business Partner.

### Out of Scope

The service give everyone the information that a bank date is classified as fraudulent by a community member. However, it does not provide the information that this fraudulent bank data is located in my own system landscape and that a company can or has already become a victim of a fraud attempt. This warning and information function is covered by the Bankdata Verification Service.
