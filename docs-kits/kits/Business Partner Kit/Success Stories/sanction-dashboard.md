Screening and monitoring of BP data records to global, regional or country specific Sanction Party lists and regulations is not part of the Golden Record qualification process.
For every company based and operating in the EU, it is de facto obligatory to check business partners and internal business contacts at regular intervals in accordance with EU regulations and the Foreign Trade and Payments Act (AWG). Every company must ensure that it does not provide funds or economic resources to sanctioned individuals or entities. Therefore, the SWD sanctions list check offers the simplest way to avoid such risks and to comply with the sanctions provisions â€“ in order to comply with Section 18 (11) of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act (AWG) and compliance with the European Union Anti-Terror Regulation 881/2002
The appropriate results have to be visible via the Sanction Watchlist Dashboard or via an API.

How is the service related to BPDM?
The database for this service consists of unique business partners with high address quality, up-to-date addresses and identifiers. In other words, the result of the golden record process.
SWD has to contain a functionality to unify the accessibility of defined Sanction Party Watchlists by defined sanction party relevant attributes into the SWD data model structure. SWD has to enrich the BP data model by defined and relevant sanction party watchlist data attributes and has to enable a unified and combined usage based on the BPN ID.
What is the Output of Sanction Watchlist Service
SWD screens and monitors a company's business partners to see if a business partner is listed on a sanctions list. This is important for every company to know whether a business partner is on sanctions lists. Especially against the background of compliance with legal or official requirements, companies operating in the EU are required to compare their Business Partner with EU Antiterror and sanction lists.
Out of Scope
The SWD Service does not contain the functionality to correct and/or enrich a business partner data record
